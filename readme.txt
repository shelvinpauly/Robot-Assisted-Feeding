Packages Required - Assistive Gym, stablebaselines3, os, multiprocessing, numpngw, IPython.display
Since, I used google Colab, the installation commands for all these packages are included in the code.

Trained model can be found in "In" subfolder
Outputs can be found in the "Out" subfolder
The python notebook can be found in the "Code" subfolder

Please contact me at spauly@umd.edu, if facing any issues with the code.
